## About
The InternIQ web application uses the InternIQ REST API to communicate with a MongoDB server. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format, making it easy to work with in web applications. The REST API in InternIQ is responsible for handling requests from the InternIQ Web Application and communicating with the MongoDB server to retrieve or store data.
 
### Used the following tools:
